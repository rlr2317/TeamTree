Description of Application class:

- Leader:
The Leader class serves as the main class that allows users to choose between editing the food and recipes list or accessing the daily logger.

- Menu:
The Menu class is the main class used to edit the entire foods list file, including adding, 
removing, or editing foods and recipes. It has its own GUI setup with buttons that provide access to other editing classes, 
and clicking on these buttons will call up the selected class and display it on the canvas.

- Add_Item:
Add_Item class is called by the Editor class to add new foods and recipes to the list. 
It has its own GUI setup for inputting all relevant information, such as calorie, fat, 
protein, and name, to add a new food and recipe.

- Remove_Item:
Remove_Item class is called by the Editor class to safely remove foods from the list. 
It has its own GUI setup with the necessary selector for all the foods currently in the list, 
allowing the user to select and remove specific foods.

- Edit_Item:
Edit_Item class is called by the Editor class to edit pre-existing foods in the list.
It has its own GUI setup for selecting foods or recipes and then editing their values, such as name, protein, carbs, fat, or ingredients. 
It also allows for changing recipe values, such as the foods used to create it.

- DailyCheckIn:
DailyCheckIn class is used to track the user's intake of food, 
as well as specific information about the user, such as their weight, to track their diet progress.
It contains all the necessary functionalities for the user to log even a day they missed inputting.

Organization of the system:
Our organization of the system utilizes a balance between cohesion and coupling. 
Each functionality has its own class, and there are two controllers: 
one focused on editing information and the other focused on using that information to track user inputs related to their diet.
